CSS file either uploaded here or link provided to the CSS file in GitHub.
The CSS "style.css" file is all the styling I used for my final project website. My website has forms, tables, images
email hyperlinks, and logos. The logo on the sidebar navigation menu is clickable and takes you to the homepage. All logos on the
website are clickable.
